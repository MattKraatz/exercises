      At Bedroc, I was responsible for the Sales Operations department, including a team of two analysts. Sales Operations was responsible for supporting the sales team in a variety of ways. I developed and refined processes and procedures to ensure accuracy, minimize risk and exceed strategic objectives. I also administered a sales forecasting process of my own design, delivered weekly to business leadership.

      Love Everybody LLC is the business arm for Big Kenny (of Big &amp; Rich fame). Here I managed the digital presences of Big Kenny and his subsidiary brands. I designed and refined marketing campaigns across the social space. I also produced and exploited viral content in a variety of mediums.
